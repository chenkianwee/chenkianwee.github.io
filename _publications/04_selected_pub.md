In this research we have developed a 3D city model of Princeton University campus for the Campus as Lab (CAL) program using openly available 3D data. The sources include the official open data portal from the United States Geological Survey, OpenStreetMap and Google Maps. The 3D city model is used as a tool for visualizing and analyzing multidisciplinary data to enhance the communication of research between different disciplines. We demonstrate the 3D model’s capabilities through a use case where we investigate the viability of powering a golf cart for short commutes across the campus with a Photovoltaic panel. We visualized environmental and transportation data. The two sets of data are solar irradiation and the travel behavior of the golf cart. Through the use case, we show that the 3D model is useful for conducting research that requires data from different disciplines. Our longterm goal is to establish the use of the 3D city model as a tool for the documentation, visualization and communication of research results in the context of the CAL program.
